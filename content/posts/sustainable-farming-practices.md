# Sustainable Farming Practices in 2025

Sustainable farming balances productivity with environmental responsibility. Modern techniques are helping farmers achieve both.

## Key Practices

- **Crop Rotation**: maintains soil fertility and prevents pests.  
- **Cover Cropping**: reduces erosion and improves soil health.  
- **Organic Fertilizers**: minimize chemical runoff and promote biodiversity.

## Technology in Sustainable Farming

- Precision agriculture tools monitor soil health.  
- Drones help optimize irrigation and fertilizer use.  
- Smart sensors reduce waste and maximize yields.  

## Conclusion

Adopting sustainable practices ensures long-term productivity and protects the planet for future generations.
