# Cybersecurity Best Practices for Businesses

Cyber threats are evolving, and businesses must stay vigilant. Here are key practices to strengthen your defenses in 2025.

## Employee Training

Human error is the top cause of breaches. Regular **training and awareness programs** reduce risks like phishing and weak passwords.

## Zero Trust Architecture

Adopt a **Zero Trust** model: never trust, always verify. Authenticate users and devices continuously.

```yaml
# Example: Zero Trust policy snippet
access_policy:
  require_mfa: true
  device_check: enforced
  session_timeout: 15m
```

## Regular Updates and Patching

Outdated software is a common entry point. Automate **patch management** to stay secure.

## Incident Response Planning

Have a clear **incident response plan** to detect, contain, and recover from breaches quickly.

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity in 2025 requires proactive defense, employee training, and resilient architecture to protect business assets.
