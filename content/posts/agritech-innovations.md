# AgriTech Innovations Transforming Farming

Technology is revolutionizing agriculture, making farming smarter, more efficient, and more resilient.

## Automation and Robotics

- Autonomous tractors and drones reduce labor needs.  
- Robots assist with planting, harvesting, and crop monitoring.  

## Data-Driven Agriculture

- IoT sensors track soil moisture, temperature, and crop growth.  
- AI-powered platforms analyze data to guide decisions.  

```js
// Example: IoT sensor data structure
const sensorData = {
  soilMoisture: 32,
  temperature: 24,
  nutrientLevel: "optimal"
};
```

## Biotechnology

- Drought-resistant and pest-resistant crops boost resilience.  
- CRISPR technology enables precise genetic improvements.  

## Conclusion

AgriTech is transforming farming into a high-tech industry, ensuring food security in a changing climate.
