# Top Cloud Computing Trends in 2025

Cloud computing continues to evolve rapidly, offering businesses scalable solutions and new opportunities. Here are the top trends shaping the industry this year.

## Multi-Cloud Strategies

Organizations are increasingly adopting **multi-cloud** approaches, leveraging multiple providers to reduce vendor lock-in and improve resilience.

## AI-Driven Infrastructure

Cloud providers now integrate **AI and ML** for automated scaling, predictive maintenance, and enhanced security.

```js
// Example: predictive scaling trigger
if (cpuUsage > 80) {
  scaleUpInstances();
}
```

## Edge Computing Expansion

With the rise of IoT and 5G, **edge computing** ensures faster data processing closer to devices.

## Conclusion

Cloud computing in 2025 is about flexibility, intelligence, and speed. Companies embracing multi-cloud, AI-driven infrastructure, and edge computing will stay competitive.
