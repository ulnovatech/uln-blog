# SEO Best Practices for Modern Websites

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) ensures your site is visible to search engines and attracts organic traffic. Hereâ€™s how to excel in SEO.

## On-Page SEO

- Meta Titles & Descriptions: Keep titles under 60 characters and descriptions under 160. Include target keywords.  
- Headings: Use `h1` for the main title, `h2/h3` for subsections.  
- Keyword Strategy: Integrate keywords naturally, avoiding stuffing.  

```html
<head>
  <title>SEO Best Practices | ULN Blog</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Learn modern SEO techniques to boost your website's ranking." />
</head>
```

## Technical SEO

- Sitemap and Robots: include `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` for crawler guidance.  
- Mobile-Friendly Design: use responsive layouts with TailwindCSS or similar.  
- Page Speed: optimize images, minify CSS/JS, and leverage browser caching.  

```css
/* Optimized image styling */
img {
  @apply w-full h-auto object-cover;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

## Content Strategy

- Quality Content: write original, in-depth articles (e.g., 1000+ words).  
- Internal Linking: link to related posts to improve navigation and SEO.  
- Consistency: post regularly (e.g., weekly) to maintain relevance.  

### Example: Internal Linking

```md
Learn more about [React performance](react-performance-optimization) or [UX design](designing-user-experiences).
```

## Conclusion

SEO combines technical precision with creative content. By optimizing meta tags, ensuring mobile-friendliness, and publishing high-quality posts, your site can climb search rankings.
