# The Future of Web Development

Web development has evolved from static HTML to dynamic Single Page Applications (SPAs). Staying ahead requires embracing emerging trends and tools.

## Emerging Trends

### 1. AI-Powered Development

```js
// AI-suggested function
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

### 2. Serverless Architecture

```js
export async function handler(event) {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Serverless!" }),
  };
}
```

### 3. WebAssembly

```rust
// Rust example for WASM
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
  format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

## Framework Wars

- React: still dominant, with a robust ecosystem.  
- Svelte/SolidJS: lightweight, compiler-driven frameworks gaining popularity.  
- Next.js/Nuxt: leaders in SSR and static site generation.  

## Tools and Automation

- Package Managers: npm, Yarn, pnpm for dependency management.  
- Build Tools: Vite for fast builds, Webpack for complex projects.  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Netlify for automated deployments.  

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
```

## Conclusion

The future of web development is fast, AI-driven, and serverless. Experiment with WebAssembly, explore new frameworks, and automate workflows to stay competitive.
